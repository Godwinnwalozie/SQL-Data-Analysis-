---------------------------------------------
--1. extract information on pet names and owner name side by side

select p.petid,p.name pet_name,o.name, o.surname  from pets as p
inner join owners as o
on p.ownerid = o.ownerid


--2. Find out which Pets from the clinic has procedures performed

select * from pets as p
left join procedureshistory as ph
on p.petid = ph.petid and proceduretype is not null

-- number of pets with procedure done
select count(*) from pets as p
left join procedureshistory as ph
on p.petid = ph.petid and proceduretype is not null

-- number of pets without procedure done
select count(*) from pets as p
left join procedureshistory as ph
on p.petid = ph.petid and proceduretype is  null

--3 match up all procedure performed to their descriptions
select p.petid,p.name,pd.proceduretype ||' :'|| pd.description as procedure_description from pets as p
left join procedureshistory as ph
on p.petid = ph.petid 
left join proceduredetails as pd
on pd.proceduretype = ph.proceduretype 
where pd.proceduretype is not null

--concat (pd.proceduretype, ': ', pd.description)


-- 4. Extract a table of cost(procedure price ) incured by owners of pets from clinic
select pets.petid,pets.name,owners.name,owners.surname,proceduredetails.price from owners
left join pets
on owners.ownerid = pets.ownerid
left join procedureshistory
on pets.petid = procedureshistory.petid
left join proceduredetails
on procedureshistory.proceduretype = proceduredetails.proceduretype
where price is not null
